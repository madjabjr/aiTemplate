# AI Prompt Engineering Console Application
## This simple console application allows the user to make and use templates that export a prompt following a prompt framework. This prompt framework is content, secondary info, system info, and prompt.

### Prompt Framework
1. Content - The content the AI would use as a basis for the prompt. This could be an article or an example of what you want.
2. Secondary Info - This is something that builds on the content. It is any thing that content does not cover, but is useful information, like who the article was written by.
3. System Info - This is where you describe the role of the AI, the rules it should follow, and other nit-picks you have. This would be something along the line for *You are a college student and your output should be X amount of words long.*
4. Prompt - This is the actual prompt where you ask the AI to do something. This is something like *Write me a paragraph describing the main points of this article:*
